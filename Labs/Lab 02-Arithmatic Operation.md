### 1. Open `lab2.py`

Open your Lab 1 repository on your computer and open the file **`lab2.py`** in your Python editor, such as **PyCharm**.

### 2. Complete the Lab

Run your program several times and make sure that you get the expected output.

### 3. Save and Submit Your Work

When you are finished:

**a) Save and submit your work on GitHub**

1. Save your `lab2.py` file.
2. Copy the content of your completed file into `lab2.py` in your GitHub repository.
3. Save and commit your changes.
4. Push your changes to GitHub.

Your submission will be updated automatically when you push your changes.

**b) Upload a copy of `lab2.py` to Omnivox as well.**

> **Note:** Do not change the names of any files provided in the assignment. In particular, keep the file name `lab2.py` unchanged.

> **Note:** Do not change the name and content of any other files provided in the assignment, otherwise you will loose grade.

### Question(s)

1. A ball is dropped from a height `h0` (in meters), and after a given time `t` (in seconds), the height `h(t)` of the ball is given by the formula:

`h(t) = h0 - 0.5 * g * t * t`

Where:
- `h(t)` is the height of the ball at time `t` (in meters).  
- `h0` is the initial height from which the ball is dropped (in meters).  
- `g` is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately  `9.8` m/s^2 .  
- `t` is the time elapsed since the ball was dropped (in seconds).  

Tasks:  

1.	Define an algorithm that describes the steps to calculate the height of the ball at time `t` using the given formula.  
2.	Write a Python program that calculates the height of the ball at time `t` after being dropped from an initial height `h0`.  
3.	Perform arithmetic operations to calculate the height of the ball at a given time.  
4.	Test your function by calculating the height of a ball dropped from a height of 50 meters at 3 different time intervals (e.g., at 1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds).
5.	Apply basic debugging techniques to check that your code works for different inputs and edge cases (e.g., when `t = 0` ).  

Example Output for calculate_height() Function:  

When running the program for calculate_height(), here’s how the interaction should look:  
```
Enter initial height: 50
Enter time: 1
Height of the ball at time 1 second = 45.1 meters

Enter initial height: 50
Enter time: 2
Height of the ball at time 2 seconds = 30.4 meters

Enter initial height: 50
Enter time: 3
Height of the ball at time 3 seconds = 5.9 meters
```

2. A car travels at a constant speed of `20` meters per second. Calculate the distance the car will travel in a given time `t`(in seconds). Use the formula:  

`distance = speed * time`

where:  
- `speed` = 20 meters/second  
- `time` = given as input in seconds.  

When running the program for `calculate_car_distance()`, the interaction should look as follows:  

```
Enter time for car (in seconds): 1
The car will travel 20 meters in 1 second.

Enter time for car (in seconds): 2
The car will travel 40 meters in 2 seconds.

Enter time for car (in seconds): 3
The car will travel 60 meters in 3 seconds.
```
# Question 1: Calculate the height of a ball

# Write your code here.






# Question 1: Calculate the height of the ball

h0 = float(input("Enter initial height: "))
t = float(input("Enter time: "))
g = 9.8

# Calculate the height of the ball
h = h0 - 0.5 * g * t * t

print("Height of the ball at time", t, "seconds =", h, "meters")


# Question 2: Calculate the distance travelled by the car

t = float(input("Enter time for car (in seconds): "))
speed = 20

# Calculate the distance
d = speed * t

print("The car will travel", d, "meters in", t, "seconds.")
